        <h1>Internet Explorer</h1> 
        <h3> The internet was barren land.<br>
            The barren land was cultivated by farmers<br>
            Farmers were coders segmenting the land into farms <br>
            Farms were websites <br><br>
            
            The coder inhabited the farmhouse<br>
            The coder had their own tools and their preferred tractor<br>
            The tools were the coding languages they knew<br>
            The tractor was their code editor <br><br>
            
            A line of code, content, and data were all seeds<br>
            All the seeds were stored in the database<br> 
            The farms’ shed was the database<br><br>
            
            The soil was the server<br>
            The farmer created several fields from the soil<br> 
            A webpage was a field<br>
            The farmer used their tools and tractor to plant the seeds in the fields<br> 
            The crop produced was the webpage’s experience<br><br> 
            
            The domain was the farm’s address<br>
            Internal hyperlinks were the tracks between the fields<br>
            External hyperlinks were the roads to other farms<br><br>
            
            The farm had visitors<br>
            Visitors used their vehicles to get to the farm<br>
            Their vehicles were browsers<br> 
            When the weather was good, the visitors got to the farm quickly<br>
            When the weather was bad, the visitors got stuck in the mud<br>
            The connection was the weather<br><br>
            
            Visitors walked on the farm leaving their footprints<br>
            Cursors were their footprints.<br><br>
            
            Jump over the fence and venture off into the barren landscape.

            The above is a poem written by Katy Brett and Jonathan Quaade.<br><br>
            
            It exists as a bedrock for how we might explore the internet’s landscape with regard to the organic world.<br><br>
